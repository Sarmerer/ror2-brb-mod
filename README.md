# Risk of Rain 2 BRB Mod

## Overview

The BRB Mod allows any player in a multiplayer session to pause the game in a more intuitive and native way.

## Motivation

While there are existing mods that offer similar functionality, I found the need to use complex key combinations or text commands in the in-game chat frustrating and inconvenient. This mod was created to provide a simpler and more seamless pause feature, ensuring a smoother multiplayer experience.

## Installation

1. **Download the Mod**: Obtain the latest version of the BRB Mod from the [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/).
2. **Install via Mod Manager**: Use a mod manager like r2modman to easily install and manage the BRB Mod.
3. **Manual Installation**: Place the mod's DLL file into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder within your Risk of Rain 2 directory.
4. **Configure the Mod**: (Optional) Open the mod's configuration file to customize the pause key and settings.

## Usage

- **In-Game Pause**: Press the configured key (default: `ESC`) to pause the game during a multiplayer session. Press the key again to resume.
- 
## Changelog

- **v1.0.0**: Initial release with basic pause functionality.
